# Generic case analysis functions

"Case analysis" functions are those which take one function for each constructor of a sum type, examine a value of that type, and call the relevant function depending on which constructor was used to build that type. Examples include
[maybe](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base/docs/Data-Maybe.html#v:maybe),
[either](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base/docs/Data-Either.html#v:either) and
[bool](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base/docs/Data-Bool.html#v:bool). `generic-case` gives you these functions for any type which implements `Generic` from [generics-sop](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/generics-sop/docs/Generics-SOP.html#t:Generic).

```haskell
maybe :: forall a r. r -> (a -> r) -> Maybe a -> r
maybe = gcaseR @(Maybe a)
```
